`traefik.toml` stores configuration relevant to the Traefik reverse proxy and SSL termination server. During the installation process, you will be prompted to update the email address and domain values if Traefik is enabled. 

Endpoints are also exposed for configuration via this file, as well as the Traefik dashboard can be enabled and disabled. Most users will not need to alter these configurations at any point in their media-docker process.
